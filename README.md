# Deep Learning Course Project

This repository contains the project developed for the Deep Learning course. The project is titled "Neural Network-Based Character-to-Symbol Sequence Translation for Text Compression".

## Project Overview

The goal of the project is to develop an innovative neural network model that can convert text into a format compatible with decompression software, providing an alternative to the process of file compression. The model is designed to translate human-readable text into a machine-readable symbol sequence that is compatible with unzip software.

The task involves creating a model that accepts a text file as input and outputs a zip file, or the contents of the zipped file, similar to the output of zipping tools like 7-Zip. 

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the modelâ€™s effectiveness, two metrics have been employed: 

1. The Levenshtein distance, which quantifies the similarity between the file created by the model and the one generated by the zipping software.
2. The 'unzip metric', which assigns a score of 1 if the selected software can successfully decompress the output file produced by the model, and 0 if it cannot.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains a Colab notebook that addresses and tries to resolve this innovative task, a project report containing the most interesting details, and a presentation. 

Ultimately, the aim of the project is to provide an alternative way of translating text into machine-readable symbols, making it easier to integrate with existing unzip tools and potentially revolutionizing the field of text compression.
